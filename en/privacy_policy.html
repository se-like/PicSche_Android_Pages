<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>PicSche (the "App") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects and how it is used and protected.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The App accesses the following information:</p>

<p><strong>(1) Camera and Photo Library</strong><br>
Purpose: To select or capture images containing schedule information (e.g. school handouts, event flyers)<br>
Storage: Images are deleted immediately after schedule extraction and are not stored within the App</p>

<p><strong>(2) Calendar</strong><br>
Purpose: To add extracted schedule information to your device's calendar<br>
Storage: Schedule data is saved to your device's default calendar app and is not stored on any server operated by the App</p>

<p><strong>(3) Text in Images</strong><br>
Purpose: To extract schedule information (title, date/time, location, etc.) via AI analysis<br>
Storage: Extracted schedule data is held temporarily in memory and is deleted after it is added to the calendar</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses external AI analysis services to accurately extract schedule information from images.</p>

<p><strong>(1) Information Sent</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Images you select or capture</li>
  <li>Instructions for image analysis</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(2) Purpose</strong><br>

<p><strong>(4) Data Handling</strong></p>

<p><strong>(5) Protection of Personal Information</strong><br>
The App only asks the AI to extract schedule fields (title, date/time, location, notes) and does not request extraction of name, address, phone number, or other dedicated personal-identification fields.
