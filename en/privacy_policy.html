<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

<p>PicSche (the "App") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects and how it is used and protected.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>The App accesses the following information:</p>

<p><strong>(1) Camera and Photo Library</strong><br>
Purpose: To select or capture images containing schedule information (e.g. school handouts, event flyers)<br>
Storage: Images are deleted immediately after schedule extraction and are not stored within the App</p>

<p><strong>(2) Calendar</strong><br>
Purpose: To add extracted schedule information to your device's calendar<br>
Storage: Schedule data is saved to your device's default calendar app and is not stored on any server operated by the App</p>

<p><strong>(3) Text in Images</strong><br>
Purpose: To extract schedule information (title, date/time, location, etc.) via AI analysis<br>
Storage: Extracted schedule data is held temporarily in memory and is deleted after it is added to the calendar</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses external AI analysis services to accurately extract schedule information from images.</p>

<p><strong>(1) Information Sent</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Images you select or capture</li>
  <li>Instructions for image analysis (including text you enter in the "image context" field)</li>
  <li>For the free plan, we manage usage counts on our server. A device-derived identifier (based on Android ID; it does not identify individuals) is sent to our API, and usage count, reward-grant count, and the relevant month are stored on our server. This allows usage limits to carry over on the same device after reinstall.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(2) Purpose</strong><br>
To automatically extract schedule information (title, date/time, location, notes) using AI</p>

<p><strong>(3) Image context field</strong><br>
Content you enter in the image context field is sent to the selected AI provider as-is. Please do not enter personal information (name, address, phone number, email, etc.) or confidential information. Input is limited to 500 characters.</p>

<p><strong>(4) AI Services Used</strong></p>
<p>The App performs AI analysis using one of the following, depending on the provider selected at build time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anthropic Claude API (<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy">https://www.anthropic.com/privacy</a>)</li>
  <li>Google Gemini API (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>)</li>
  <li>Our own API using Vertex AI: images and prompts are sent to our API (e.g. Google Cloud Run), which uses Google Cloud Vertex AI for analysis. Processing is subject to Google Cloud's privacy notice (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice">https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The service used depends on the App's build configuration. Supported providers may change without notice for improvements.</p>

<p><strong>(5) Data Handling</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Images are deleted from the server immediately after API analysis</li>
  <li>Processing is in accordance with each AI service provider's privacy policy</li>
  <li>The App is configured so that user data is not used for AI training purposes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(6) Protection of Personal Information</strong><br>
The App instructs the AI to extract only schedule-related fields and not to extract personally identifiable information (name, address, phone number, etc.). However, we cannot guarantee complete prevention given the nature of image content.</p>

<p><strong>(7) Advertising (Google AdMob)</strong><br>
When you use the free plan, the App uses Google AdMob (Google LLC) to display ads.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information that may be collected: device identifiers, advertising ID, IP address, app usage, etc. (as described in Google's Privacy Policy)</li>
  <li>Purpose: To display and deliver ads and optimize ad delivery</li>
  <li>Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
  <li>If you use the Basic or Premium plan, ads are not shown and the above data collection for ad delivery does not apply.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
<p>Collected information is used only for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extracting schedule information from images</li>
  <li>Adding extracted events to the calendar</li>
  <li>Improving the App and fixing issues</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the free plan, device information etc. may be collected by Google AdMob for ad delivery and optimization. See "Third-Party Services" – Advertising above.</p>
<p>The App does not use information for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tracking user behavior (except for ad optimization)</li>
  <li>Selling or providing data to third parties (except as required for AI analysis API and advertising services)</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Image data: Deleted immediately after analysis (retention: seconds)</li>
  <li>Extracted schedule data: Deleted from the App after calendar registration</li>
  <li>Events added to the calendar: Stored in your device's calendar app until you delete them</li>
</ul>
<p>The App does not store user data on any server, except that for free-plan usage management we store usage count, reward-grant count, and the relevant month linked to a device identifier on our server.</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>The App does not share your information with third parties except:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When required by law</li>
  <li>When you have given consent</li>
  <li>As described in "Third-Party Services" (AI analysis API use)</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>The App protects your information by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keeping images only temporarily (no permanent storage)</li>
  <li>Using encrypted API communication (HTTPS)</li>
  <li>Minimizing data kept in the App</li>
  <li>Configuring AI services so that user data is not used for training</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

</ul>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
